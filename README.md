# <img src="assets/satty.svg" height="42"> Satty: Modern Screenshot Annotation.

Satty is a screenshot annotation tool inspired by [Swappy](https://github.com/jtheoof/swappy) and [Flameshot](https://flameshot.org/).

![](assets/usage.gif)

Satty has been created to provide the following improvements over existing screenshot annotation tools:

- very simple and easy to understand toolset (like Swappy)
- fullscreen annotation mode and post shot cropping (like Flameshot)
- extremely smooth rendering thanks to HW acceleration (OpenGL)
- working on wlroots based compositors (Sway, Hyprland, River, ...)
- minimal, modern looking UI, thanks to GTK and Adwaita
- be a playground for new features (post window selection, post paint editing, ...)

## Install

Thanks to our package maintainers, Satty is available for many distributions on Linux and BSD:

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/satty.svg)](https://repology.org/project/satty/versions)


### Arch Linux

You can get the official Arch Linux package from the AUR:

```
pacman -S satty
```

### Gentoo

You can get the Gentoo package from the Guru overlay:

```
eselect repository enable guru
emerge --sync guru
emerge -av satty
```

Pending PR for Gentoo overlay: https://github.com/gentoo/gentoo/pull/33908

### Alpine Linux

Satty is available in [Alpine Community](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=satty&branch=edge&repo=&arch=&maintainer=). You can install it by uncommenting the community repo in `/etc/apk/repositories` and then run:

```
apk add satty
```

### Prebuilt Sources

You can download a prebuilt binary for x86-64 on the [Satty Releases](https://github.com/gabm/satty/releases) page.

## Usage

Start by providing a filename or a screenshot via stdin and annotate using the available tools. Save to clipboard or file when finished. Tools and Interface have been kept simple.

All configuration is done either at the config file in `XDG_CONFIG_DIR/.config/satty/config.toml` or via the command line interface. In case both are specified, the command line options always override the configuration file.

### Shortcuts

- `Enter`: as configured (see below)
- `Esc`: Exit application
- `Ctrl+C`: Save to clipboard
- `Ctrl+S`: Save to specified output file
- `Ctrl+T`: Toggle toolbars
- `Ctrl+Y`: Redo
- `Ctrl+Z`: Undo

### Configuration File

```toml
[general]
# Start Satty in fullscreen mode
fullscreen = true
# Exit directly after copy/save action
early-exit = true
# Draw corners of rectangles round if the value is greater than 0 (0 disables rounded corners)
corner-roundness = 12
# Select the tool on startup [possible values: pointer, crop, line, arrow, rectangle, text, marker, blur, brush]
initial-tool = "brush"
# Configure the command to be called on copy, for example `wl-copy`
copy-command = "wl-copy"
# Increase or decrease the size of the annotations
annotation-size-factor = 2
# Filename to use for saving action. Omit to disable saving to file. Might contain format specifiers: https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/format/strftime/index.html
output-filename = "/tmp/test-%Y-%m-%d_%H:%M:%S.png"
# Action to perform when the Enter key is pressed [possible values: save-to-clipboard, save-to-file]
action-on-enter = "save-to-clipboard"
# After copying the screenshot, save it to a file as well
save-after-copy = false
# Right click to copy
right-click-copy = false
# Hide toolbars by default
default-hide-toolbars = false
# The primary highlighter to use, the other is accessible by holding CTRL at the start of a highlight [possible values: block, freehand]
primary-highlighter = "block"
disable-notifications = false

# Font to use for text annotations
[font]
family = "Roboto"
style = "Bold"

# Custom colours for the colour palette
[color-palette]
# These will be shown in the toolbar for quick selection
palette = [
    "#00ffff",
    "#a52a2a",
    "#dc143c",
    "#ff1493",
    "#ffd700",
    "#008000",
]

# These will be available in the color picker as presets
# Leave empty to use GTK's default
custom = [
    "#00ffff",
    "#a52a2a",
    "#dc143c",

### wlroots based compositors (Sway, Wayfire, River, ...)

You can bind a key to the following command:

```
grim -g "$(slurp -o -r -c '#ff0000ff')" -t ppm - | satty --filename - --fullscreen --output-filename ~/Pictures/Screenshots/satty-$(date '+%Y%m%d-%H:%M:%S').png
```

Hyprland users must escape the `#` with another `#`:

```
grim -g "$(slurp -o -r -c '##ff0000ff')" -t ppm - | satty --filename - --fullscreen --output-filename ~/Pictures/Screenshots/satty-$(date '+%Y%m%d-%H:%M:%S').png
```
